In this article, we demonstrated how to train and deploy an XGBoost model on the Iris dataset using AWS SageMaker. We walked through a Python script, explaining each line of code in detail. The process involved preparing the data, uploading it to Amazon S3, training the model, deploying it to an endpoint, and making predictions using the deployed model. AWS SageMaker simplifies the training and deployment of machine learning models, offering built-in algorithms, managed resources, and seamless integration with other AWS services like S3. This script serves as a template for training and deploying other machine learning models on SageMaker.
