In this repository, we demonstrate how to train and deploy an XGBoost model on the Iris dataset using AWS SageMaker. The Python script provided explains each step in detail, including data preparation, Amazon S3 upload, model training, endpoint deployment, and making predictions using the deployed model. AWS SageMaker streamlines the training and deployment of machine learning models, offering built-in algorithms, managed resources, and seamless integration with other AWS services like S3. This script can be used as a template for training and deploying other machine learning models on SageMaker.
